# About
In early March 2016, MS financial controllers held a teambuilding event. They split into teams, each produced a video, then they voted on the videos in the style of the Oscar Gala. 
They asked DX to create a simple voting website and we saw this as a chance to do an informal local hackfest and try our hands at ASP.NET Core and the new Web tooling.

# Notes
This project was created with ASP.NET Core RC1.
